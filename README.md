This project was made to showcase my Github Repositories, with Repos navbar showing the projects i have worked on on my Github. 

I made four navigation bars which include Home, Repos, Error404, and ErrorBoundary. With the Home link showing the welcome page, Repos showing my Repository and and Error404 showcasing the errors.
